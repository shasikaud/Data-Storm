# Data-Storm
Repository for the datastorm 

We were given a dataset to predict the customers who might default credit card payments. A default can occur when a borrower is unable to make timely payments, misses payments, or avoids/stops making payments. Banks need help in predicting and preventing credit card default to improve their bottom line. To solve this problem we used various feature engineering techniques and classifiers to end up with the optimum features and classifier for this classification tasks. Finally we will be presenting our business insights for this problem.
